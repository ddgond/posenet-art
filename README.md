## PoseNet-Art
 PoseNet Art is an interactive app where the userâ€™s motion activates real-time animations and sounds. It is meant to be used for creative and entertainment purposes.

 PoseNet is a machine learning model for real-time pose estimation. We used a PoseNet implementation from ml5.js. We used p5.js to create animations and Tone.js to create sound effects.

 PoseNet Art was created by three MIT students in the fall of 2020 as part of the inaugural cohort of AI@MIT Labs.
